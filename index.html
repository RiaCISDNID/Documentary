<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Project Reflection web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year-old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are, what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this program with my students and interns at the University of Pittsburgh to help them strategically package the work they have accomplished in their project/internship/teaching assistantship. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web document that helps you process your experience, and through the process, you'll learn a little bit about coding.

BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design. They are here to help you through the making process. Once you have finished editing, follow the directions on the repository ReadMe to learn how to publish your webtext to GitHub.-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Project Name" to whatever you want. The "META" information below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens like cell phones or desktops.

<!--Replace the project title and provide a flashy subtitle. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything in this html. code, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. First replace the el1.jpg with a .jpg or .png in the project folder (hint: simplify the name). Then use your text editor to open your style.css sheet, find the hero image, and replace p1.jpg with the name of your new image-->

  <h1>Project</h1>
    <h2>Hi! My name is Ria Chadha, and my goal was to create a documentary where my audience could watch as new mastana members navigates through the highs and lows of being on the University of Pittsburgh's premiere bollywood fusion dance team.</h2>

<!--Add more images to your project folder for a photo grid, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add to the names on the grid below on this html file. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...see what happens--you have to be playful to find out how things work. You will want to resize large images that will take too long to upload--at the same time you don't want them pixilated. Around 1200px wide should work well. It's also essential that you add ALT TEXT to describe your images for users with a wide range of disabilities.-->

    <h1>Role</h1>

    <h2>I was the sole creator of the entire documentary - from filming the content you see on the screen, to editing the sound, footage, and special effects - I scripted and developed the project into what it is now.

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h1>Impact</h1>
     <h2>Ultimately, I had full control over which direction the material went in. My goal was to limit my video to 15 - 30 minutes long. I wanted to portray as much emotion about the team as possible. I feel that often, when you discuss emotions, you spend more time trying to understand it rather than feeling it – the meaning can get lost in the explanation. This is the primary reasoning behind why I think most would want to choose a shorter video to send out their message. However, the emotions I am trying to show are not fleeting – and especially for those who might not have any idea what being on a dance team entails – there's going to need to be context. I decided to start with a broad overview of what the organization I was covering was. Then, through interviews and behind-the-scenes clips, as well as emotional music and rapid cutscenes, I began to show the audience a heavier side to the team, which was the reason I wanted to make the video longer.</h2>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h1>Moving Forward</h1>

    <h2>I learned that making a documentary is no simple process. While I had a lot of material and content to present, I realized that you need to be able to package every minute of it in a way so that the audience is being given something new to look at. As the only developer on this project, I was quite a task, and I feel that there are many areas of this film where I could improve. I did feel, however, that I was better able to understand how to convey emotions through a screen. Every visual element plays a role, no matter how big or small, in making the audience take away a thought or feeling. In my future career (marketing and video design) based on audience reactions and my own experience with editing this video, I think I will be able to connect with my viewers a little easier, and be able to understand how to market content in a way to get the most reaction possible.</h2>
